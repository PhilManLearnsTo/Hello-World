You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

<!--- Lastly, encapsulate the URL in parentheses "()" --->
 To include a link to an image use the format: "\!\[Alt Text\]\(URL\)"

### Image Example 1
-------------
![kestrel](https://github.com/PhilManLearnsTo/Hello-World/blob/master/images/MAN_0389-lo-res.jpg)

<!--- This example is image linked by it's internet URL --->
Image example 1 is linked by its internet URL:

"https://github.com/PhilManLearnsTo/Hello-World/blob/master/images/MAN_0389-lo-res.jpg"

### Image Example 2

![cormorant](images/MAN_9988-lo-res.jpg)

<!--- This example is image linked by it's internet URL --->

# Hyperlinks
-------

<!--- To format an  URL: [Alt Text](url) --->
<!--- Firstly put the "Alternative Text" enclosed by square braces "[]" --->
<!--- Note: the "Alternative Text" is optional. --->

<!--- GitHub will automagically recognise the link --->
Or you can just enter the URL with no special tagging:

e.g. https://www.github.com
